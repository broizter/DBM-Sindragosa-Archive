# HOW TO INSTALL FOR THE FIRST TIME
**Disclaimer: If you have used DBM before and you wish to save old DBM profiles, backup your WTF folder, because we will be performing a clean install as this is a retail backport and therefore it is not compatible with 2010's version of DBM. To proceed with the clean installation process, do the following steps:**

1. On your addons folder (Interface/Addons), select every DBM folder (everything that starts with DBM-) and **delete** them.
2. On your SavedVariables folder (WTF/Account/[AccountName]/SavedVariables), select every DBM file (everything that starts with DBM-) and **delete** them. **THIS STEP WILL REMOVE YOUR DBM CONFIGURATIONS/PROFILES!**
3. On **each** of your Characters SavedVariables folder (WTF/Account/[AccountName]/[ServerName]/[CharacterName]/SavedVariables). Select every DBM file (everything that starts with DBM-) and **delete** them. **THIS STEP WILL REMOVE YOUR DBM CONFIGURATIONS/PROFILES!**

**With no remnants of old DBM files we are now ready to start the installation process.**

1. Download the latest release from GitHub (https://github.com/broizter/DBM-Sindragosa/releases/latest/download/DBM-Sindragosa.zip).
2. Open the zip file and copy/Paste all folders (DBM-Core, DBM-GUI, etc) into your addons folder (Interface/Addons).
3. Load your game client into your character selection screen. On the bottom left corner, click AddOns and enable all the DBM entries like so:

# HOW TO KEEP THE ADDON UPDATED
Updating DBM follows the standard procedure that applies to any addon installation. Everytime there are new changes*, do these steps:
1. Download the latest release from GitHub (https://github.com/broizter/DBM-Sindragosa/releases/latest/download/DBM-Sindragosa.zip).
2. (**Advisable**) On your addons folder (Interface/Addons), before pasting, select the DBM folders that are there and delete them (you will not lose your profiles doing this, don't worry - those are on WTF folder and there is no need to touch that anymore). This ensures that there is no remnant file that could potentially conflict with latest releases.
3. Open the zip file and copy/Paste all folders (DBM-Core, DBM-GUI, etc) into your addons folder (Interface/Addons).
